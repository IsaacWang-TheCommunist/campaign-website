<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Public Policy @ Duke University</p>
<br />

<h3>Officer of the US Navy</h3>
<p>
  I served on active duty for 4 years and continue to serve in the US Navy
  Reserves today. San Diego and the Navy have been home for the past 9 years. My
  wife and I have chosen to raise our family here, despite knowing it's not easy
  for military families to afford the high cost of living. I'm very passionate
  about helping other veterans transition into fulfilling civilian careers,
  especially in entrepreneurship.

<h3>
  Tech Entrepreneur
</h3>
<p>I'm currently in a business incubator for military veterans.</p>
<p>
  My co-founder and I are building political campaign software that provides
  geospatial analysis and data visualization for campaigns and advocacy groups.
  Our software helps candidates figure out who to reach out to and how to
  strategically organize field campaigns.
</p>

<h3>Transportation Planning</h3>
<p>
  The idea for my tech startup came from combining my love for grassroots
  organizing with my love for urban planning and GIS. I worked for a year in
  active transportation planning, improving our street design to be safer for
  pedestrians. I believe elected officials can serve their people better through
  data-informed decision making in conjunction with robust community input.

<!-- <h3>Civic Technologist</h3>
<p>
  Digital modernization in local government can significantly improve the
  delivery of city services. I head a volunteer organization called Open San
  Diego that improves gov ops through better data, intuitive web design, and
  reducing needlessly redundant tasks. Our work brings programmers, data
  scientists, designers, activists, and local officials together to collaborate
  on projects to improve the city.
