    <h3>URBANIZATION STRATEGY:</h3>
    <p>How do we design cities that encourage average residents to participate in creating a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable urban form?</p>
<br>
    <h3>DIGITAL MODERNIZATION OF GOVERNMENT:</h3>
    <p>How do we create a 21st century government that uses forward-thinking technology to improve community engagement and deliver ersponsive government in accessible, pleasant, and efficient interactions?</p>
<br>
    <h3>FIXING MECHANICS OF DEMOCRACY:</h3>
    <p>How do we create a legal landscape that supports citizen-centric feedback loops and prevents special interests and corporate money from disproportionately influencing both elections and policy making?</p>
<br>
    <h3>WHAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY HERE?</h3>
    <p>30-40% of our government will retire in the next 5-10 years.  Millenials will be the majority in government.  The entire culture will shift to reflect our values and prefreences, and our next elected officials will shape that transition.</p>
    <p>Without a foundation to attract talented + innovative people, we risk recruiting a generation of low performing civil servants who will stay until their retirement.</p>
<br>
    <h3>HOW WE WIN</h3>
    <p><strong>MARCH 3</strong>: We need <strong>11,000</strong> votes.</p>
