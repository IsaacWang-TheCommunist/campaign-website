<h2 class="emphasize-header" 2>Why am I running?</h2>
<p>I believe our Relationship with government is fundamentally broken.</p>
<p>
  Government is not a vending machine: <br />
  Put money in, get a product.
</p>

<p>
  "I pay taxes, so I deserve a functioning government" is an inadequate way of
  creating good governance. Effective government requires a strong feedback loop
  between elected officials and citizens, where both sides engage with each
  other.
</p>
<p>
  We fix this feedback loop by shaping physical environments, digital
  environments, and legal environments to be conducive to vibrant civic life.
